_Supplementary Material for_ Variations on the Bergman Cyclization Theme: Electrocyclizations of Penta-, Hepta-, and Octa-Diynes
===================================================================================================

Welcome to the supplementary repository for the 5-7-8 project! Here, we make
available the software that was written to facilitate the automatic generation,
performance, and analysis of nucleus-independent chemical shift computations
during the course of this project, together with XYZ-formatted structure files
for all molecules optimized herein.

Enjoy!
