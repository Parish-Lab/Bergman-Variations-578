Analysis & Automation Software
==============================

During the course of this project, there were several occasions where either
the setup/performance of computations themselves the or analysis &
visualization of data required that assistive software be developed. Contained
in this directory are three examples of this software:

- `nics_helper`: Automating the placement of NICS probes for general (even 
non-planar, non-symmetric) cyclic molecules
- `rxn_path`: Reaction path interpolation for generating improved seed structures
for transition state searches
- `iwpert`: Automatically perturbing molecular structures from a Q-Chem frequency
computation's output file along specified vibrational modes
- `rxn_profile`: Visualize the energetic profile for a reaction
